                Five years a journey, a hand, a youth bet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hello, my name is Anh. I was born on 5/5/1996. Currently Co-founder and owner of FUSIONISM.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did not create it, but I gave up my youth, strength and spirit to build FUSIONISM. With wishes when you
                enter the store. You will find shirts with stories that reflect your own mood. We don't just sell clothes, we
                are where you find empathy
              </p>
              <p>
                We have always thought that sadness is something extremely beautiful. If you don't have sadness, how can you
                appreciate the happiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope that we will accompany you in long days of youth. A memory, a story, a memory and a sweet thing ...
              </p>
              <p>
                Fusionism means unity. Someone came, someone went, someone stayed. These 5 years from loneliness I have found
                companions with me. I do not know this path, this story I will go anywhere. Close it once and open it again.
                There is success, there is failure. Hope you all will welcome us again ...
              </p>
